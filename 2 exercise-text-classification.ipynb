This was not just dark but you could not see something right in front of your face. \n\nThe waiters/waitresses were all blind and allowed us to see how aware you need to be without the vision. \n\nTaking away one sense is said to increase your other senses so as taste and hearing which I believed to be true in this experience. \n\nThe meal was extremely delicious. I had the chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I also had a surprise beer which was a nice surprise. \n\nThe whole experience was unlike anything I have ever done and I hope this spreads to other cities. \n\nA must do! \n\nNEGATIVE: They won't book new patients for same day appointments. My dog is sick but it's not necessarily urgent so I asked when I would be able to book an appointment and was told \"new patients book out at least 6 weeks in advance\" so just a heads up this seems like a great vet from other reviews but it'll be hard to get in their system to know \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It looks like your model is working well after going through the data just once.
